      <p>Here at MTHS, if you are not interested in the computer science and aerospace pathways and are more into the scientific fields of study, then Biotech is a great option. Through the Biotechnology program, students will gain beneficial experience through many projects that combine academic learning and laboratory skills. Unlike in the other two pathways, the biotechnology pathway only offers two STEM courses being Biotechnology class itself and STEM English 12. Most students will take Biotechnology as a sophomore, and STEM English 12 as a senior. </p> <br>

    <div class="card-content">
      <p style="color: white">The Biotechnology course itself is a very fascinating class for many as it takes the students through many lab activities and projects. Similar to a course like IED, Biotech is a team based class and does not stress so much on tests. In this course, students will most likely only be expected to do one test the whole year and some smaller quizzes. The main emphasis are labs where groups of 4-5 students experiment in various topics such as DNA fingerprinting or even gel electrophoresis. In addition, students are able to explore their interests when doing big research projects in groups involving a poster board and an essay. They can present their research to their fellow classmates, ultimately spreading knowledge to others involving interesting scientific studies. Moreover, this program provides many strong careers within the scientific fields and all it takes is your full effort and participation to excel in this STEM department.</p>

    <h1>Gel Electrophoresis Lab</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="card-content">
    <p>As said before, the majority of the class time is used towards group labs and the Gel electrophoresis Lab is one of the most popular labs Biotech students can participate in. The Gel electrophoresis laboratory method allows  students to observe DNA, RNA, or proteins that are pushed and separated by an electrical field through a gel that contains small pores. However, before any labs like this popular one takes place, students learn how to complete proper lab reports in their notebooks in order to make the most use of the labs they participate in. Once these basics are met, they can start the Gel electrophoresis lab by writing their hypothesis about a certain question that can be observed in the lab. Once enough observations are made and data is collected, the group comes up with a conclusion and compares it with other groups. This doesn't only apply to the Gel electrophoresis lab, but applies to almost every lab done in this course.</p>

    <h1 style="color: white">The Final Project</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="card-content">
    <p style="color: white">Other than group labs, the one other huge activity that takes place is the final project. This is a group poster board that will consist of an essay and other research about a topic relating to Biotech. The great thing about this project is that students get a broad range of topics they can research about and have tons of space on their boards to gather this information on. For example, some students did research on GMOs and how they are used to improve the time of production. They then tied this in with the negative effects of GMOs such as the deathly amount of pesticides embedded in the crops. The projects that shine the most are those that can relate to many around and these GMO’s are very popular in America, as well as many other places, because farmers can profit much more than if they grew organic crops slowly. Furthermore, most classes would just let students present it to the class, but in this class students will take their poster projects to the STEM/BIO expo. There, students will be able to not only present it to their own classmates, but to the whole school district. Students from every school in the district, as well as teachers and adults, will be able to observe and learn from other projects which creates an overall awesome learning environment.

  </div>
  <div class="card-content">
    <p>Penny Lefavour is the primary educator of the Bioscience pathway as she currently teaches Biotechnology, AP Biology, and STEM English 12, which all fall under the requirements for a Bioscience STEM diploma. Lefavour’s roles of Eco Club and IATRIX 21 advisor, an environmental club and girls’ STEM club respectively, also reflect her passion for biotechnology. Throughout her life, Lefavour has always stayed in motion. She grew up in the Midwest, toured Europe as part of a musical group and performed across the US as a singer. While she had experience in both music and education, Lefavour understood the difficulties of pursuing music and decided to focus on teaching. Lefavour is no stranger to the inner workings of the education system after she’s held positions as a teacher and administrator in Illinois and Washington. From time to time, she extends her biotechnology skills outside of the classroom to collaborate with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute to conduct studies.
