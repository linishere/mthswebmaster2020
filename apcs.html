        <p>AP Computer Science, or APCS, is the next step in computer science, and is taken after CSP. Juniors can choose between APCS or IEE, and in APCS, will dive into other languages, such as C/C++, Java, and take a more in depth look into HTML, CSS, XML, and XSL. The class is structured the exact same way as computer science principles, with most of the grade coming from assignments and quizzes on occasion. Along with this, students will have the chance to earn AP test credit after taking the AP test in May, along with receiving the UW credit.</p>

      <div class="card-content">
        <p style="color: white">In APCS, CSP students continue to learn to program with the language Java. In APCP, students work to design, implement, and analyze their own programs. Rather than follow instructions on an assignment, students are given more freedom to come up with their own solutions without barriers. They implement their solution into a certain scenario, then ensure that their program works in an intended way. Students test and debug their programs, while ensuring that syntax rules are followed, there are no runtime exceptions, and that the program and all algorithms are correct. In APCS, student apply what they learned in both CSP and IED to ensure they follow the design process to create their programs, up until they produce a well-polished solution. Students use techniques they learn to produce a year-long project that they work on every Friday, similar to their project in CSP. </p>

        <h1>Standard Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>In APCS, student continue to learn more about functions, data types, and concepts. These include the double, char, and string data types, strings, classes, lists, and arrays. Arrays and classes are arguably the most difficult concepts to learn in this class, requiring significant time and effort by students. Students expand their coding vocabulary by learning how to use functions they never touched in CSP, learning how to program more efficiently. In addition, students learn how to use algorithms in their programs, which were only briefly mentioned in CSP. Algorithms in APCS focus on operating on data structures, searching terms, and sorting terms. Students complete various assignments throughout the year to polish their newly learned skills, including the critters project, where students create a game based on animals. </p>

        <p style="color: white">In addition to learning how to program, APSC students learn big world concepts such as system reliability, privacy, legal and intellectual property, as well as social and ethical implications of computer use. Students learn how to safely browse the internet, how to avoid legal trouble, ensuring privacy, and so forth. </p>
