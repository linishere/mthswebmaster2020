      <div class="card-content">
        <p>Computer Science Principles, or CSP, is the first step into computer science. Sophomores taking this class will utilize the programming software, processing, to complete various assignments. This class also touches up on HTML, CSS, XML, and XSL, but focuses on processing. Processing is a software that uses the language Javascript, but contains more integrated features to appeal more to beginning programmers. Quizzes will be assigned on occasion, and are always announced ahead of time. Quizzes are always on pen and paper, and students cannot use the computers while taking their quiz, demonstrating their understanding of coding languages. Additionally, students learn about bigworld computer science concepts, such as bits and bytes, networking, area networks, and more.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p style="color: white">In CSP, students primarily use the coding language Processing, which is based off of JavaScript. Throughout the school year, students learn proper syntax and coding style, how to use comments and headings, and many coding techniques, including functions, classes, arrays, and more. During the course, students learn new concepts through lectures and slideshows, taking notes in their engineering notebooks to use on future assignments. As students learn more about Processing, they complete assignments that test their new skills. Assignments such as a “Ghost” project allow students to create a Pac-Man ghost on the Processing monitor, and move the ghost around with arrow keys. Other projects, such as a “Monster” project, require the use of classes to fill the entire Processing screen with jumping monsters. Throughout the end of the first semester, students pursue a Processing project of their choice which they work on every Friday, up until the end of the year when they demonstrate their project to their class. When students submit assignments, they receive eleven points for turning their project in, then three points each for functionality, code style, and commenting style.

        <h1>Website Design</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>In addition to learning Processing, CSP students learn other languages to aid in designing basic websites. These languages include HTML, CSS, XSL, and XML. Students spend three weeks learning how to design a basic website, and are required to build a website to showcase their Processing Friday Project using all four of the previously listed languages. Students spend time on a learning website as well as working with each other to learn the ins and outs of these four languages. In order to create a primitive website, students learn about tags, headings, attributes, fonts, how to import pictures, and more. As with Processing, students are expected to maintain proper syntax and coding style, as well as appropriate use of comments. By the end of the year, students will have built a working website that acts as a showcase of their Friday Project. </p>

      <div class="card-content">
        <p style="color: white">As well as learning how to code and program, CSP students also learn about data and information use throughout the world. Students take notes on lectures explaining ideas such as net neutrality, party protocol, LAN’s, HTTP protocol, and so forth. Furthermore, students learn how these ideas and concepts affect the world’s use of the internet through information exchange. Students learn how the internet works, as well as the creation of web addresses and more. These “Big-World” ideas help students understand the global implications of the internet, mass exchange of information, as well as safe internet practices.</p>
