      <p>If you like airplanes, rockets, or simply building real objects, aerospace is the pathway for you! Aerospace consists of engineering courses that teach students how to expand on the design process they were taught in IED. Students will learn how to use formulas to determine structure efficiency, aerodynamics, levers, building techniques, and more! There are three aerospace classes offered as follows: Potentials of Engineering (POE) for sophomores, Introduction to Aerospace Engineering (IAE) for juniors, and STEM English 12 for the seniors. On top of all that, all aerospace students can receive college credit for taking these engineering courses!</p> <br>

      <p style="color: white">Principles of Engineering, or POE is the prerequisite to Introduction to Aerospace Engineering. In POE, students embark on a journey of equations and construction, determining the most efficient bridge designs and lever designs. Some projects include large scale bridge building, pulley projects, and more. In POE, lots and lots of equations are utilized, so make sure you're sharp on your algebra two! POE teaches students how to create efficient structures, and the reasoning to why certain structures succeed and why others fail. As well as this, tests are simple and easy with retakes available for every test. On top of these benefits, POE offers college credit to all students who participate, meaning students can start building their college transcript now!</p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-content">
    <p>For the first few weeks of POE, students spend time learning about basic physics equations to use in their future designs and calculations, as well as simple machines. Students learn about equations in a way similar to math classes, which they are then tested on for proficiency. Afterward, students study simple machines, such as levers, to apply in later projects. Students undertake a project to demonstrate their knowledge of simple machines by choosing a task and building a structure to complete it. One such task, pushing down a stapler, can be achieved by releasing a weight from a pulley onto the stapler. </p>

    <p style="color: white">Similar to the TSA event Structural Design and Engineering, POE students learn how to build and test structures, with the highest efficiency the key goal. Students learn how to use online structure simulators to design and test digital structures before constructing their own out of wood. Students assemble a bridge in the simulator, then drive a truck through the bridge to ensure the structure can hold it. If the bridge holds, students determine the efficiency of the bridge, then build a different bridge to try to best their efficiency. Later in the curriculum, students work in teams to build a large wooden bridge, around eight feet long, three feet wide, and three feet tall. They stack weights on the center of the bridge to see how much weight the bridge can hold before breaking. </p>

  <div class="card-content">
    <p>Near the end of the year, POE students learn how to design, build, and code machines to complete a certain task. At MTHS, POE students use the readily available VEX Robotics kit as well as the program Robot C. Students learn basic coding techniques that they can use to program simple robots and machines. Students pursue a semester long project during the spring, choosing a task they want their robot to complete. They spend the semester designing, building, coding,and testing their machine. Machines range from marble sorters to basic vending machines. With this, students can learn both mechanical engineering as well as computer science.</p>

    <p style="color: white">Introduction to Aerospace Engineering, or IAE, stems off of POE and continues where juniors left off as sophomores. After having learned structure efficiency in POE, IAE teaches students the idea of aerodynamics; what works, what doesn't work, and why. In aerospace engineering, students will create wooden planes and test them to see how far they fly, with and without a propeller. IAE provides hands on experience for students, and they will have plenty of time to use tools and wood throughout the course of the year. Along with building planes, students will create composite materials, and much more! Just like with POE, students can receive college credit for IAE, giving them a head start to their college career!</p>

    <h1>Balsa Girders</h1>

  <div class="card-content">
    <p>The first project in IAE is to design and build a rubber band powered balsa girder. The goal of this project is to design the most aerodynamically fit girder that travels as far as possible when launched. Students use a glider simulator to find out what makes a good glider and what makes a bad glider. Using design skills from IED and POE, students design balsa girders in Autodesk Inventor. After completing their designs, IAE students create their girders out of balsa wood. Some students decide to laser cut their planes, while others prefer to hand-craft them. Students then test their planes by launching them with rubber bands. Students then adjust things on their plane such as the weight and control surfaces.</p>

    <p style="color: white">Through the end of the first semester and beginning of the second semester, students work on producing airfoils to create the most aerodynamic plane. Students work in teams of two to design and carve airfoils out of foam. Each team will produce a unique design. After carving them, students attach their foils to a standardized plane and test them by flying them around a pole structure. A scale is used to determine the lift on the wing. After each team’s airfoils are tested, the results of the lift of each wing are tabulated and compared. Next students will use that airfoil design to create a wing which will be used on a LEAF competition plane. </p>

    <p>By the middle of second semester, IAE students work to produce the strongest possible composite beams. Students work to produce the strongest possible material by layering different compounds such as styrofoam, carbon fiber, wood and more. Student also use various shapes and patterns, such as a honeycomb design, to create the most efficient composite. Students test their composite materials in a computer automated stress test analyzer, which determines the total weight a the composites can maintain. Students work to design and prototype their composites to produce the highest possible efficiency. After all students finish testing, their efficiency results are tabulated, and the student with the highest efficiency has their design showcased to the rest of the class. </p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-content">
    <p style="color: white">Mr. Smelcer was born and raised in Washington state. After finishing high school, he decided to join the military for a few years before returning to Washington to attend college. Originally, Mr. Smelcer intended to pursue nuclear physics, however, he decided to become a teacher instead, as he did not feel he could make a significant impact as a nuclear physicist. Teaching, on the other hand, allowed him to have a direct impact on the lives of others, and so, that is the career he pursued. Originally starting as a middle school teacher, he was hired as the MTHS engineering pathway teacher and chemistry teacher. After the retirement of the old aerospace pathway instructor, Mr. Craig DeVine, Mr. Smelcer became the head of the pathway. With a laid back personality and strong sense of commitment, Mr. Smelcer always tries his best to have a great impact on his students. His teacher website can be found here: https://mths.edmonds.wednet.edu/teacher_websites/smelcer__bryan_-_science_english.
