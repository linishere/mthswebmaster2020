            IED is the first class in high school for enthusiastic participants
            of the STEM program. The only qualification for enrollment into IED
            is that students must be in Geometry, or any higher level math
            course. Throughout the course of IED, students will learn how to go
            through the design process, sketch multiview drawings, use CAD, and
            ultimately, build successful projects. As well as all this, IED
            students who happen to be in tenth grade or higher can receive
            college credit from the UW as Engineering 114.

                IED is a class of teamwork and leadership. Unlike other classes,
                there are no "tests" or "exams," but rather long term projects
                worked on in teams consisting of four to six members. In the
                first few weeks, students will go through lectures learning how
                to use CAD, the design process, orthographic sketches. After
                that, students will take part in fun and innovative projects,
                with little to no restrictions on what students can build. As
                equally as important, students learn fundamental presentation
                techniques to showcase their completed projects. Grades are
                based on student effort, and not so much on their completed
                project; the class teacher, Mr. Wilson, finds that it is "cruel
                to grade fourteen year olds on their final creation." Receiving
                an A is as simple as putting forth your full effort!

                Before tackling large scale projects, students must first learn
                the design process, proper use of their engineering notebook,
                how to draw orthographic sketches, and how to design models in a
                CAD program. Students are each provided with an engineering
                notebook, and spend the first two weeks through lectures,
                learning how to properly use their notebooks, as well as draw
                isometric sketches, then three view dimensioned orthographic
                sketches. Students spend time modeling basic 3D printed objects
                in their engineering notebooks as orthographic sketches,
                complete with all necessary dimensions. After completing basic
                engineering notebook sue skills, students move into learning how
                to use CAD to design models. In IED, students use a powerful
                program called Autodesk Inventor, which contains all the tools
                students need to design anything they wish. Students learn how
                to draw and model parts, as well as assemble parts together
                within the program. Students follow the book, Parametric
                Modeling with Autodesk Inventor 2018, to learn various tools
                within Inventor and complete first-step assignments before
                taking on their first project.

                After learning basic CAD skills and the engineering design
                process, students take on their first large scale project: CYOA.
                CYOA, or Choose Your Own Adventure, lets students sketch,
                design, and fabricate two abstract 3D printed parts of their
                choosing. Students must first learn how to use power tools, such
                as the drill press, belt sander, and bandsaw, before proceeding
                to take on this project. After passing a shop safety test,
                students choose two abstract parts and produce orthographic
                sketches of them in their engineering notebook with all
                necessary dimensions. After that, students replicate the part in
                Inventor to test their CAD skills. Finally, students use slabs
                of wood and fabricate the two parts by glueing, drilling, and
                cutting the wood to replicate the original 3D printed Parts.

                The next project for IED students is TITB, or Think Inside The
                Box. This project calls for students to design a wooden box for
                any paraphernalia of their choosing. With this, students are
                able to choose both the size and functionality of the box, which
                will be constructed from wooden sheets and ¾ inch wooden
                blocking. Students must first create isometric sketches of the
                box, with dimensions, then move on to designing and assembling
                the box in inventor. At this point, students create an
                orthographic sketch of each of their components and their
                assembly in Inventor, adding all necessary dimensions. In
                addition, students create an exploded view of the assembly,
                which depicts how all parts go together to form a box. Students
                then head to the shop, and use all necessary power tools to cut
                out pieces for the box. Finally, students learn the glue and
                screw technique, using wood glue to adhere components together
                before screwing parts together with a hand drill. The result is
                a wooden box that varies based on the desire of its creator.

                With CIN, or Client In Need, IED students learn a crucial skill
                to the engineering design process: customer constraints. With
                CIN, students work in teams and select a random card depicting a
                cartoon character, as well as another card explaining what the
                students must create for the character they selected. Students
                spend time studying their character’s card, looking for hints
                and details as to what type of personality the character may
                have, which will help them design their chosen item. Students
                brainstorm ideas and each team member creates three sketches of
                how they think their client’s item should look and function.
                After students decide on a final design, they work to model all
                parts in Inventor. Students follow the exact same procedure as
                they did in TITB, creating a model of their design, as well as
                orthographic sketches. Finally, students 3D print their final
                model followed by a group presentation explaining their final
                design to the rest of the class.

              <p>
                GOT, or Game of Thrones, is very similar to CIN. However, rather
                than receiving a fictional client as a customer, students must
                design a chair for a real life client. Students can choose to
                design a chair for companies such as Ikea or Mandula (a yoga
                company), and must act as if their company will actually
                purchase their chair from them. Students enter the field, often
                watching and taking notes as customers purchase chairs at their
                selected company. Eventually, students use their notes and
                observations to develop a chair based on the needs of their mock
                company. As with CIN, students work in a group to brainstorm
                ideas, eventually selecting a chair as their final design. After
                sketching and designing the part in Inventor, teams lasercut a
                small version of their chair and assemble it to ensure that all
                pieces fit together properly. If their chair passes the test,
                students cut out a full sized version of their chair from a four
                foot by eight foot piece of wood on a large CNC machine.
                Finally, students present on their chair, explaining their
                design process as well as how the chair meets their client’s
                needs.

                Mr. James Wilson is MTHS’s IED teacher. Mr. Wilson has spent
                most his time in Washington, where he received his high school
                education at Edmonds Woodway High School and teaching degree at
                Western Washington University. After a mentorship at Mt. Vernon
                whilst leading their TSA, Mr. Wilson took interest in Texas
                after going there for the national TSA competition. He decided
                to move there for a few years, fascinated by the culture. He
                served as a TSA and robotics advisor in his time there, helping
                his students take home top awards. Eventually, he moved back to
                Washington, where he was employed by the Edmonds School District
                to teach IED, but ceased to advise technology clubs. However,
                three years, he had reinstated himself as the MTHS TSA advisor,
                and is leading his school to victory, all while obtaining his
                Master's in October 2018.
