      <p>In order to ensure that all students receive full financial benefits in our TSA, we have developed several fundraising techniques over the past three years. Being STEM students, most of our fundraisers consist of the sale of custom-designed items. Our TSA students design, prototype, manufacture, and sell various items, notably holiday decorations, in order to raise money for the group. Along with that, we have also hosted a Red Onion event, which is a restaurant in the city of Mountlake Terrace. In raising money for our students, in the past three years, we have ensured that all students receive free TSA membership, materials, leadership conference attendance, and regionals conference attendance. On top of that, we have provided several students with a total of $6565.00 in scholarships to date.</p>

        <div class="card-content">
          <p style="color: white">Two summers ago, MTHS neared the completion of the Raise the Hawk Project: The installation of a massive Hawk statue near the front entrance of the school. In order to fundraise money, MTHS offered dedications on the statue for sale, where customers could write anything they wished, which would go on a placard on the statue. In order to complete these placards, MTHS approached their TSA chapter during the summer to design and fabricate the dedications. After over a month of hard work, TSA produced over sixty dedications, raising over $700.00.</p>
          <h3 style="color: white">The Design Process</h3>
          <p style="color: white">The first step to designing the dedications was to meet with the head of the project to determine the best possible size, design, material, and color of the placards for our recipients. After a two hour meeting, the initial design for the title was created. We would offer two sizes, being 4 inches by 8 inches and 8 inches by 8 inches, as well as the color black with white lettering and borders. The tiles would be simple in design with text in the center and a small outlining border. A blank tile was then designed in the CAD program CorelDraw, then the blank would be duplicated to fill the bounding box of our laser cutter. The customized text would then be added to each blank tile, then the file would be cut and engraved in the laser cutter. Each tile would be transferred to the project leads, who installed them on the base of the hawk statue. In all, the MTHS TSA received $10.00 for each tile, raising a total of $770.00 in the end. </p>

          <h1>Holiday Bazaar and Santa Breakfast</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
          <p>Three years ago in November, the TSA leadership committee decided to take advantage of two schools "farmers market" type events being the Holiday Bazaar and Breakfast with Santa, both lasting six hours. At these events, individuals could vend items that they created for a nominal fee. Most vendors put up expensive art or handcrafted items up for sale, however, we took a much different approach; “Nickel and Diming.” To prepare, students designed snowflakes, ornaments, and Christmas trees in various sizes to be laser cut out of acrylic. After the success of the prototyping stage, students helped mass produce the items for our various events. Our TSA made $487.25 at the Holiday Bazaar, and an additional $231.15 at the Breakfast with Santa, and sold out of items both times in 2016. After the success of our Christmas decorations, we decided to allow students to sell these items, self-fundraising for their state and national competitions. An additional $286.00 was made in December of 2016, meaning that our TSA fundraised nearly $1000.00 in a period of only two months.

      <p>The success of the Holiday Bazaar and Santa Breakfast in 2016 lead our TSA to repeat these two fundraisers. Rather than selling the same items, we decided to design snowmen ornaments, intricate wooden ornaments, and snowmen earrings in the anticipation of returning customers from last year. We created a larger stock of products to ensure we would have enough to meet demand, and this proved very successful. With ambitious advertising and marketing, our TSA managed to pull in $434.0 from the Holiday Bazaar and $178.00 from the Santa Breakfast. Despite the lower numbers compared to the previous year, significantly less people showed up to both events than in the previous year. Similar to the previous year, a few students sold leftover items we had in stock to self-fundraise money to go towards their state fees. Various students raised $206.66, bringing our total holiday earnings up to more than $900.</p>
      <p>The third year of the Holiday Bazaar saw the third year of success. With the same goals and principles in mind, we created a three-dimensional tree ornament and decided to try something new, creating DIY wooden cabin kits for kids to put together. With that, we sought to capture the attention of previous customers once again. In addition, we expanded our reach, setting up at a venue in Edmonds as part of the Edmonds Holiday Market, as well as a senior center farmers market in Edmonds. We created an even larger stock of products compared to last year, making our best efforts to promote our cause, selling items to raise money for our students and program. Entrusting a large part of our fundraiser to the careful hands of new TSA members, we could run multiple fundraisers in different places at once, expanding our reach and profit margins. With rigorous planning and marketing, this year’s Holiday Bazaar was our best year yet, producing more than $1300 over a short period of three weeks.

          </div>
          <div class="card-content">
            <p>Fundraising over $1,000 with inexpensive sheets of plastic has to do with the nature of the design. At both the Holiday Bazaar and Santa Breakfast events, our TSA created an appealing booth and backdrop, full of LED lights, fake snow, and an ornament display stand. We grabbed the customer's attention, then explained that we created all of our items from scratch; that's the key seller. It turns out, that adults would much rather buy professional-grade items from hard-working students than from the stores. The cheap nature of our items contributed to our success as well, as most of our items were impulse buys. We designed our models in Autodesk Inventor, then laser cut them out of crystal clear or white acrylic, depending on the model. After that, the two-part models were assembled, and that's all it took to build a successful fundraiser! A model of our snowflake ornament can be seen in the picture on the right.</p>

          <p style="color: white">After the Holiday Bazaar and Santa Breakfast come to a close in each year, we offered our extra stock up to students to sell to friends and family in order to raise money for themselves. Similar to the selling of chocolate or pretzel sticks for sports fundraisers, TSA students can earn money towards their state fee for every holiday decoration they sell. Students gain access to an online form, which they can send to their potential customers. For each completed form, the TSA leadership team organizes products for each customer. The customer will then pay their student, who will then give the money to the MTHS TSA in exchange for the purchased product; the money is then set aside for later use when calculating the cost of student competitions. In all, several students have fundraised nearly $500.00 for themselves, making the state and national competitions more economically friendly. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
          <p>Red Onion is a restaurant in Mountlake Terrace, only a couple blocks away from our school. Unlike other restaurants, Red Onion hosts fundraisers for any organization in the area every Tuesday of the year. For the first time in a few years, the MTHS TSA decided to participate in the Red Onion fundraiser. The policy was that we send six students, three members and three officers in our case, to help out at the restaurant on the day of the fundraiser. We would try to bring in as many people possible through school advertisements, and we would receive a cut of the profits, all cash tips, and a cut of the credit card tips from the restaurant. Two years ago, our Red Onion fundraiser happened in January, the week after Christmas, and this turned out to be a bust. The day back from winter break simply was not a great day for fundraising, and most people we had previously informed about the fundraiser had forgotten by the end of winter break. In the end, we made $237.77, and this was evenly divided between the people who participated.
          </p>
          <p>The second-year turned out to be a different story. Learning our lesson from last year, we decided to conduct our fundraiser in February of 2018, well after the end of winter break. We took advantage of advertising techniques such as working with other STEM club leaders to support our fundraiser and sending out mass texts to each STEM student at our school, encouraging to support the MTHS TSA at the fundraiser. This fundraiser proved much more successful than in the previous year, bringing in people to fill the entire restaurant. In the end, we pulled in over $400 from customer purchases and tips. </p>
