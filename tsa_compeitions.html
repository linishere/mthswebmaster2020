      <h1>TSA Meetings</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="card-content">
      <p>At MTHS, we officially meet with our chapter every Thursday, from 2:00 - 3:00 pm. On the Tuesday before that, our school’s TSA leadership committee meets to discuss the agenda for the following Thursday, but other members are encouraged to attend as well. Our meetings are structured to fit logistics and important events or updates within the first thirty minutes of the meeting, leaving the next hour to prepare projects for the state competition. At the MTHS TSA, our main goal is to be great leaders, and to train excellent leaders for the future!</p>

          <p style="color: white">In MTHS TSA, our students compete in an array of events, ranging from children’s stories to engineering design, to even biotechnology design. We provide students with all the materials that they need for success in their event and ensure that they never have to spare a penny. Students are welcome to, but not required to attend the regional TSA competitions in the winter to receive helpful feedback. After that, students compete at the state level, and some students move on to the national level.</p>

          <h1>Structural Design and Engineering</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
          <p>Structural Design and Engineering is the key event of MTHS TSA, as well as the most popular event. Teams spend months preparing, building, and testing bridges using a computer-automated structure tester. Our teams spend hours upon hours of their time working with the state judge, observing structure failures, and revising their old bridges. Award-winning teams will build up to five structures before deciding on a final design. In the past, we have taken consistent first-place awards and near sweeps in structures, having now won the state event three years in a row. Materials are purchased with fundraising money to ensure students can compete in this event for free. We send as many teams as possible to the regional and state TSA competitions, and the team that performs the best will represent our school at the national competition. In addition to success at the state competition, Structural Design and Engineering teams from MTHS have taken 4th place, 1st place, and 2nd place at the national competition, three great feats for Washington school teams. The structure below took a runaway first-place finish at the WTSA state competition in 2016 and took fourth at the National competition in Nashville the same year. For the sake of our structure teams, we are unfortunately unable to publish any of the newer structure designs.

        <div class="card-content">
          <p style="color: white">Similar to Structural Design and Engineering, we have multiple students who compete for our school in Dragster Design. In fact, we often have to use the regional competitions to determine the students who will represent MTHS at the state conference, for we often exceed the student limit for this event. Our students work long and hard hours, exploiting power tools and different types of wood to create the lightest and most aerodynamically fit dragsters. Students from our school have consistently brought back state awards over the past few years, including 1st and 2nd place two years in a row, with our school holding the first place title for three years in a row. We order any materials that the students request without ever asking them to source the materials themselves. The dragster to the right received first place at TSA state last year and went on to race at the national competition. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
          <p>Although this is only MTHS TSA’s third year participating in Animatronics, this event is quickly becoming the most successful for the chapter. One of the most difficult events to compete in, students are required to put in over forty hours of work each designing, coding, and testing their animatronic robot. Two years ago, a team of five students designed, coded, and assembled an autonomous toy alligator, which would roam around a room avoiding objects and reacting to anything obstructing its path. The team spent hours upon hours finalizing their design, but only managed to receive 2nd place at the state competition. However, with a redesign of the entire alligator’s body and programming, the team managed to finish in 9th place at the national competition, ranking higher than the opposing state team that took 1st place from them at state. Learning from the previous year, last year’s team started earlier and implemented a higher number of complex functions. Deciding to build a snapping turtle, the team managed to build a fully autonomous robot by the end of the year, capable of detecting food, traversing a room, and reacting to stimuli. After a year of hard work, the team won their state competition and received a 4th place finish at nationals. This year, the team decided to build a Glyptodon, and hope to further improve over the past year.

          <h1 style="color: white">Essays on Technology, Debates</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
          <p style="color: white">In the past few years, our TSA has been doing well in the two events Essays on Technology and Debating Technology Issues. Essays on technology is an extemporaneous event that our students love competing in. Students are given ninety minutes to research sources and construct an essay, similar to an AP test, SAT, or ACT essay. We have strong English teachers at MTHS, meaning that the curriculum they teach helps us become better writers for Essays on Technology. Additionally, students have taken more of an interest in Debating Technology Issues. For the past few years, we have sent at least two teams to compete in this event, maximizing the chance for success. We have competitive debate groups at our school who, more often than not, participate in TSA's own Debating Technology Issues. We have managed to pick up a first-place finish in Essays on Technology, as well as several second and third-place finishes. Students from Terrace have been on stage for essays five years in a row. Furthermore, our school’s debate teams often make the stage, and we have taken home several top-three finishes. This year, we are sending two highly competitive students to compete in essays, and two teams to compete in debates. Wish us luck!

          <p>Although our TSA puts a large focus on Structures, Dragster Design, Essays, and Debates, and Animatronics, we consistently participate in over half of all TSA events offered. This year, our TSA has increased membership to over forty students, and on top of that, students are now competing in three to five events each rather than three or fewer. This means that we have been able to increase our participation in the competitive events offered at TSA competitions, increasing our stage presence in the process. The complete list of events that we compete in, as well as the number of participants in these events, are listed below.
