      <p>STEM English 12 is the final class that STEM students will take, and every student shall take this course regardless of their pathway. The class is taught by two different pathway teachers, being Mr. Smelcer and Ms. Lafavour, with Mr. Smelcer teaching both the aerospace and computer science pathways. In STEM English 12, students will use all that they learned in their previous three years to develop a final senior project. Although every senior STEM student takes STEM English 12, students normally stick with their pathway teacher to ensure that students are surrounded by peers of their pathway, but this is not required.</p>

            <p style="color: white">STEM English 12, or STEMEng12, is a combination of a STEM course and English course, all packed into one! Students will spend nearly all of their time working to produce their final project, which can be anything of their choosing based on a contemporary issue in the world. This means utilizing the design process, procuring a mentor, designing, prototyping, and so forth. Students write written reports on their accomplishments in hopes that they will have a successful final project. So what can students make? In the past years, final projects of students range from hydro-energy from pipes to music transcription software, to even cancer treatment! Students can choose any topic they wish as long as they can realistically research and develop their topic. Students do not have to present a working solution, but rather a prototype that showcases their best efforts.

          <p>For the most part during this whole course, students work on their STEM projects that they chose to pursue. On a daily basis, students are required to write down what they accomplished for the day. They have a daily log to keep track of all that information. Students can work on a project individually or partner up with fellow students. Once they know who their group consists of, they can focus on what they want to make. The studentsâ€™ pathway will usually determine what their project will consist of. For example, if you are in the computer science pathway, one component of your project will most likely include the use of Arduino or other digital electronics platforms. Students will brainstorm for weeks, researching what type of things they could make that would be unique and useful. After students decide on what they would like to work on, they will have to send a design proposal to their teacher to verify if the project is appropriate or not. </p>

          <p style="color: white">The design proposal consists of what students are creating, why they are making it, and the steps they will take to complete their projects. Nothing ever has to be set and stone, however, peers, instructors, or others should have a clear idea of the project a student intends to pursue. Once completed, the class instructor will look at factors such as if the project can be completed in a  realistic timeframe, cost of the project, safety and ethical issues, student management of the project, and so forth. Once the project is approved, the students can finally start working on their projects. Each student receives a $200.00 budget for their project, and this budget stacks up if students are working in teams. Throughout the entire year, students conduct research, define problems, design, and prototype possible solutions, eventually creating a well-polished project. Students take their projects finished competing at the Central Sound Regional Science and Engineering Fair (CSRSEF), as well as the Washington State Science and Engineering Fair (WSSEF).
