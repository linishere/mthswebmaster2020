				<p>Our TSA was founded seven years ago by Haeley Johnston and Mark Burbank. Haeley Johnston is now a college sophomore at Western Washington University, but she played a key role in the establishment of the MTHS TSA. Back when she was just a highschool freshman, Johnston approached Mark Burbank with the idea of starting a TSA at MTHS, just like the one at her previous school, Brier Terrace Middle School. That year, MTHS became an official TSA chapter with a limited group of members. For her next three years, she ensured that our school accomplished big feats in TSA, such as first place wins, awards of recognition, and so forth. As a senior, Haeley served as the WTSA president, and did all in her power to ensure that our state was in good hands. Thank you Haeley Johnston!</p>

				</div>
				<div class="card-content">
				<p style="color: white">Three years ago was the worst year for the MTHS TSA. Leadership was at an all-time terrible, where some of the officers only showed up to a single meeting. Fundraisers for our club were non-existent, meaning that students had to pay for all membership dues, material costs, and registration costs by themselves. The leadership team that did show up to the meetings was unorganized, resulting in lower attendance every meet. Most freshmen students hope to continue their winning streak from middle school were disappointed by the MTHS TSA. By the end of the 2016 WTSA season, we only took home two first-place wins in Structures and Dragster design, ironically by three freshman newcomers. After the year was over, the entirety of the old leadership was voted off, and the newly elected leadership consisted entirely of hard-working sophomores. </p>

				<p>A year of setback would be followed by a successful year for MTHS TSA. Although lacking experience, the new leadership team sought to expand TSA through advertising, pursue new fundraising techniques, increase leadership experience throughout the entire group, and most importantly, keep members engaged throughout the entire year. During this year, every meeting had an agenda, keeping all students engaged and setting new goals to heighten student standards. Membership skyrocketed from less than fifteen members in the previous year to over thirty by the WTSA competition of 2017. In addition, over $4,000 was raised through design and distribution fundraisers, school grants, and rotary grants, ensuring that all students could acquire competition materials for free, and in some cases, attend competitions at a reduced cost. This year saw plenty of success for MTHS at the state and national competitions, with Terrace appearing on stage for ten events, as well as securing the first place win for the Structural Design and Engineering national championship. The road for success would only continue for the MTHS TSA. </p>

				<div class="card-content">
				<p style="color: white">The start of the 2017-2018 school year looked bright for TSA. After rigorous advertising, the chapter garnered over fifty active TSA members with forty registered for the 2018 WTSA state competition. The leadership team pursued ambitious fundraising goals, raising over $10,000 by the end of the year, going as far as cutting the cost of nationals from $1,400 to $640 per student. The increased treasury allowed the officer team to more liberally distribute funds, allowing students to receive the highest quality materials for their events. Older members better prepared for their events, ambitious to take first place in their events. Even younger freshmen members, sparked by the motivation of their peers, began to invest dozens of hours into their projects, hopeful to stand on stage in the comping state competition. Furthermore, this was the first year that the MTHS TSA hosted a regional competition, which saw an attendance of over forty TSA students from Mountlake Terrace HS, Juanita HS, Edmonds Woodway HS, and other schools. By the end of the year, MTHS TSA took home seven first-place state finishes, with a plethora of other top-five finishes, and brought home a 2nd and 4th place finish at the TSA National Conference. </p>

          <h1>The Founder's Last Year</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
          <p>The 2018 - 2019 school year marks the last year for the students who turned around their TSA. At the beginning of the new year, close to 80 TSA students attended the first MTHS TSA meeting, filling up the entirety of Mr. Burbank’s oversized classroom. An enormous number, the leadership team took great care to meet the needs of our numerous members, fundraising as much as we could to support our growing chapter. By the middle of our season, we sent more than forty members to our TSA regional leadership conference, winning every award in the boat competition, except for the Titanic Sinking Award (which we could not win, as none of our boats sank). By the state competition season, very few of our first meeting members left, and we are sending 65 students to this year’s state competition, nearly double what we sent last year. With an ambitious group of students, we hope to take the competition by storm, showcasing our best in each of our events. As the seniors say goodbye to their TSA program, they will pass down the torch of leadership to their younger members, passing down everything they know to keep the flame of TSA burning for years to come.
